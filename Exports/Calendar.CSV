Subject: RE: MSCB/ITD/F-338/375/2017-18 - ** Technical Presentation & Demo** - 24-25th May

 

Prasad, We discussed earlier today regarding this. Can you come back on this.

Manish B,
We did a demo of Flexcube for ESAF and Fincare opportunities in a day. The demos were elaborate and covered a lot of the functionality. We have the plan for presentation from both demos. We can leverage that scripts to start with. Both Demos were 2 day long sessions, similar to the MSCB ask.

Please identify at least 3 presenters not including sales and leadership to help with the demos from Oracle.

1. Flexcube Retail
2. Corporate
3. Consulting

The Schedule for ESAF was as follows

Session 1: 10:00 - 01:00 CASA RD, FD, Payments & remittances (RTGS, IMPS, NEFT, etc), CTS & Clearing, e-channels (internet banking, mobile banking, Call Centre, Kiosks, ATM), Reporting
Session 2: 2:00 - 06:00 Flexcube Corporate, Flexcube Architecture, Integration Architecture, etc.

We will run some sessions in Parallel to the other sessions on Day 2 if required. We have done this earlier. Some Sessions like Treasury will need limited audiances. 

Let me know who will help us with this and I will organize a prep call tomorrow morning.

Thanks
Satyen

Hi Manish B

We spoke on this. Waiting till June 2nd / 3rd week will be very late as we are expecting RA to be happening in that time frame. Appreciate if you can plan this to be held immediately after / before the Finnacle demo, so that things remain fresh in the mind of the customer and we can drive the conversations effectively. Duration can be worked with the client.

@Anit: Please check with the client the alternate slots available for this demo.

Thanks and regards

Hi Awadesh, Anit

We won’t be able to do the demo on above days. As communicated to IBM earlier, team is only available in June 2nd or 3rd week to do MSCB demo.

Also, Oracle itself will need 2 days to show case complete Core banking & Digital offering. We need to ask MSCB for at least 3 days of product walkthrough. 

Thanks & Regards

· Please provide a self-declaration on bidder’s letter head stating that
The Managing Director

ANNOUNCEMENT

Following the transition from Project Accounting to Project Financial Management (PFM), we are pleased to announce the go-live of the Consulting Sales Tool (CST) for administering the commission calculation for the Consulting Sales Line of Business. 

EFFECTIVE

Q3 FY18 Payment Cycle

DETAILS 

Prior to the Consulting Sales Tool (CST), revenue were manually calculated and administered in Excel and the sales employees were provided Excel statements. With this custom tool, revenue will now be assigned via automated process for transaction booked in Project Financial Management (PFM). This is a major benefit to both the Consulting Sales and Compensation Administration team globally. Consulting Sales employees will now be able to view their commission statements any time with clear visibility of their transaction details and payments online. 

In order to accommodate this process change, two live training sessions will be scheduled. They will focus on how to access and interpret the data and answer any tool related questions.

As always call me OTP. That makes things fast. Landline is best -080-6659 3028.

 

-Raghu

Subject: Re: Canara CBS Upgrade: Draft OD from Oracle

  _____  




Raghu,
This is the last version of the OD I have from you. Based on this, the following are Open Points. We need to track these to closure.

1. Rights Granted section currently provides IP Ownership on all custom code to Oracle. We need the Extensibility layer changes and Integration Gateway Changes to be excluded from this.

<Raghu>We discussed this point. No update to the OD is required.


2. Section 2.2 in Schedule S has not been included in the OD.

2.2.           “You may allow Your agents and contractors (including, without limitation, outsourcers) to use deliverables for Your internal business operations and You are responsible for their compliance with the General Terms and this Schedule S in such use.”


<Raghu>This section does not apply to you. But if Canara were to contract with us, then, it makes sense to include this.                                                                                                                                               

 

3. Warranty Period on the Code Should start from date of acceptance and not from date of delivery.
<Raghu>What’s the issue here when Canara has an AMC and managed services contract with us. This MSC will take care of issues, if any.

 

4. Section 12 is pending Canara Bank's comments/confirmation (Confidentiality Clause). - Pending with Canara Bank
5. Section 13 (a) does not match the language in column V. However, a new section 13 (b) has been included. Please see if this meets your business requirement (Escrow). - Yakub to Come Back. IBM is waiting for Client View on this. <Raghu> The intended meaning will stay same. We need to correct some error in language. I will do so.
6. Section 14 (a) is subject to resolution of the audit issue with Canara Bank (Termination). - Pending Canara Bank
7. Section 20 does not match our requirement. Satyen? (Assignment) - Canara Bank Confirmation
8. Serial number 26 is pending closure with Canara Bank. OD to be updated appropriately. - Pending with Canara
9. Payment Milestones cannot be time bound. Please keep them aligned with delivery milestones. Payment Milestones Def. have been shared with Raghu

<Raghu> I understand that Avadhesh is closing this with Vinayak

10. Please include a breakup between the (Retrofits + IL + Interfaces) and all other services in the OD to facilitate our internal reviews - Closed 
11. In the Rights granted, please clarify that Canara Bank has Rights in this lines. Oracle retaining the ownership, however Oracle should provide Canara Bank (and, its vendors, on behalf of Canara Bank) right to modify, enhance, operate, upgrade, add, replace, prepare derivative works, and distribute to subsidiaries post merger. - Duplicate of 1….
12. Please update the acceptance criteria for UAT (4+1) & SIT Phases to reflect that the Sev 1, 2 Issues will be resolved for the milestone to be achieved. 

<Raghu> Page 10, Section 13, Point p takes care of this.
13. Necessary clause for Hindi Language…<Raghu> Added already…If not will add it.
14. The Statement in the brackets in Scope binding is superfluous - On Pg. 6. It has to be dropped as anything out of the scope in attachments is handled through CR.

<Raghu>   This is required. It does not contradict anything elsewhere.
15. RACI Precedence has to put the RACI Overriding the Text. 

<Raghu> First…these two should be consistent. If any conflict, the body of the OD should take care.  Otherwise all the discussions that we have been having lasting several months & the agreement that we arrived at becomes irrelevant. We did a RACI only at your insistence. We don’t want that to take precedence over the basic document. Best thing is to Remove the RACI. Both of us can rest in peace.

 



Thanks
Satyen

By Strategic issues, I mean - Future proofing the bank, Drives the strategic vision of the bank

Deeply technical issues will address: Many challenges  that you have shared with us..like ghost bugs, archiving,  staging test data,  batch timings etc

                we will have to check the availability of Venky & Vinayak for the call at 1.00 PM IST & will send the invite.
 
2. Don’t worry about getting thrown out just because of the price. In my view,  EBL will not ‘Shoot first and then ask questions’. And considering that this proposal is not in response to a well-defined set of requirements, we won’t be any trouble that we can’t come out of. That said, every item in the BOM addresses a stated need; no frills anywhere. 
- we discussed this during the  last call, we are working with the IT team of EBL to avoid the RFP Route. We do not want EBL to invite competition for the RFP process so we will have to give them a very good proposal.
- IT team was mentioning time and again during my meeting with them and on the call that they need a good solution at a good price. 
 
3. We will work on optimizing the price as we get some sense of the following:
 
		a.       What EBL really wants to do and over what period?
		b.       What is EBL’s view of the proposal we just sent out.
		c.       Price ask from EBL.
		d.       What does the competition have to offer?
		e.       Some idea of the budgets, etc.
		f.        By when do they really want to close the deal.
We discussed this during the call on 26th March 3016
			 
4.   Please write back why you think that ‘It is high’.  That will help my internal discussions and also jumpstart our 1pm call. BTW, giving something ‘low’ does not assure that EBL will close in a hurry. We tried that in Jan. 
- Last proposal submitted in the month of JAN, We had a proposal presentation with them during the mid-JAN. EBL was mentioning the price was very high. 
- We received the additional requirement during the workshop and the 
- My conversation with them last week they have a budget for the  License upgrade, Customization and the BB Guidelines (budget was not disclosed to me). If the price will over shoot the budget they will look at other options.

Dear Vinayak, Manish, Raghu
 
Let’s get on a call tomorrow to discuss on the commercials. The consulting price I received is high & we will get shot down. The relation with ELB and Oracle was not going well for the past few years, we have got this back on track. Now we will have to work with them and take this closure. Please have a discussion internally to optimise the price.
 
With Regards
 
Shine

Subject: RE: EBL Slides v1.0
 
 
Anuja / all,
 
In addition to or along with this proposal, there’s a need to cover these themes in a Use Case driven workshop. :
 
1.	BBG : Do walk thru of BBG supported (85%) and unsupported items and show how it is supported. Note they want to validate every claim we make on the extent of support available and then what they can do on their own. The product that can show a higher day1 compliance with BBG will be an automatic preferred solution – 1 day
		 
2.	Other functionality : sessions demonstrating capabilities in (i) CASA/OD/TD calculations, (ii) key new country requirements – Inter-Bank FT using National Payment Switch Board, Excise Duty in CASA/TD/Loans,  (iii) Dual Auth / Multi level auth / overrides handling in front office, (iv) flexibility and capabilities in defining Loans schedules, capitalization, payments, (v) capabilities with SDEs in Loan re-classification (Status Change) to transfer different types of amounts, (vi) Loan servicing after maturity date (rate change, mat. dt. extn., principle change) – because in B ‘desh overdue loans is the most common thing and not being able to change any loan attribute after mat. dt. will mean they are in the same situation as before, (vii) Limits – flexibility to decouple start / end dates from a/c opening, (viii) Collections. Note EBL wants functionalities more than any of the below value adds : 2 days
 
3.1   ODT-DIY : Choose some 3 items for DIY-ODT ‘how to do’ demo from the list of retro + customizn + BBG items – across UI, validation, back end processing with hook, interface (GI), batch, report type changes. This should be a Webex followed by an in-person workshop. This is because Bank still seems to have this perception ODT-DIY is an oversold concept and only cosmetics are possible. Note our main challenge in B’ desh is much of the capability gaps / system limitations are no different in 14.0 than 10.x. So weak areas in #1 and #2 have to be shown solvable thru #3  – 0.5 - 1 day
 
3.2   API : Present key APIs and show them how quickly they can consume them in a service. Again this is part of ODT but should be done as a separately called out exercise. This is because Bank view is this was sold during 10.x also but they found the services cannot be used straightaway and they have to pay Oracle to implement and make them usable. They need to see an e2e API driven I’face build with their own eyes, like screen/function change in #1.  – 0.5 day
 
3.3 Data Model : Present Open Data Model and show them how quickly they can define a user defined report. Again, this should one item from the upgrade components list – 0.5 day
 
4         Digital : At the end of OBDX demo, if we can show OBDX can be made to call an FCUBS API as part of some CEMLI item, then it will sell both OBDX and FCUBS APIs – 1 day
 
5         PLI : A simulation of a process driven discovery / PWT, testing phase – 0.5 day
 
6         Support : demonstrate local presence with some model that shows them we understand their requirements and are committed to Bangladesh. This is in addition to our Support model of MOS, 24 * 7 remote support etc.. 
 
While Zahid seems to feel capability demonstration is a good idea but we should wait for their requirement doc to come out, since we are sending out a proposal in any case, might as well offer an action plan / workshop right away with the above content. One way or the other, the above our combined USP / value prop should revolve around the above themes.

Hi Anuja,
 
1. Looks like we are all now on the same page. 
 
I wish too that DIY was much more, but then its won’t be ok to claim more than this(‘15’). 
 
2.  If you still think we must discuss one more time  before we send this over, then let’s do a call anytime Sat/Sun.  
 
(Please send a whatsapp message once the call is scheduled because some of us do not  check Oracle mail frequently on weekends.)
 
3. The language in the consolidated deck slide 10(which was slide 7 in my pack) has changed. Please use the updated slide from what I have sent. (‘I have dispensed with the term “pain areas” )
 
 
It looks like a decent version 2.

All,
 
I understand that the final consulting classification is as per Column H in the excel and I am sticking to that. I have simply reclassified items for a simpler PPT representation – please refer to Column G in the excel for the same. For e.g. In the ‘supported’ bucket I have added ‘operational’, ‘partially supported’, ‘included in some other items’ – so the total supported bucket goes to 696.
 
Please refer to the PPT for the final table. The overall fitment to BB guidelines has now come down from 88% to 84% (this includes things like NA to EBL and FO / MO requirements). 
 
We have the option of taking this 84% to 93% by including DIY….:) Let me know your thoughts.
 
Please review and in case of questions, please call me directly or let me know if you want to setup a call. We need this finalized by tomorrow.
 
Regards,
Anuja

Hi Anuja,
PFA the xl sheet with the classification on the line items as on 30-Jan-2018 in column H  (as per Deck shared)and the classification shared by Raghu (in column G)  in the mail below. 
 
The classification as per Sales deck had 176 unsupported items  classified as under:

Available in New version	33	
Do it Yourself (DIY)	109	
Duplicate/Others	6	
FO/MO/Treasury	12	
Pending EBL Validation	16	
 	176	
 
Of the 176 items, 5 items  falling in the category of Pending EBL validation had appeared in DIY category as well and as such need to be removed from the Pending EBL Validation category. These are highlighted in Yellow  in the attached xl sheet in column H. As such, the count of items for reconciliation purpose will be 171. 
 
The revised summary as per Sales Deck with additional classifications for the other items is as below.  The count of items highlighted sums up to 171 items as mentioned above.

Anuja,
 
	a)       The following table is the ‘fact’ of the matter. This table has come from Sanjay Ghosh’s team. 
	b)      I want to start with 899 and treat that as the base and take credit for the 675 that are already supported today.
	c)       Doing (b) would be an acknowledgement of  the bank’s right choice of FC 10.5.
	d)      Once you do that, it’s easy to see how the other numbers stack up. I will be happy to go into details if required.
	e)      Coming to the core issue: DIY by the bank would be much smaller than we have conveyed in Jan. For consistency sake, we can stick to it, but that does not seem to be a correct representation. 
	f)        Left to myself, I would be guided by Sanjay’s assessment to the DIY capability of the bank and share that honestly with the bank. 
	g)       Your feedback on slide 43…I agree. Lets do it once the bank asks us for details.

All,
 
I have consolidated the content and enclosed for everyone’s review. 
 
*	Slide 11 – this is what was presented to the Board and needs to be our anchor slide  
*	Slide 39 – This has a total of 899 items which don’t add up to the 176 mentioned in slide 11
*	Slide 43 – Commercial option 2 – There are 2 additional line items – additional customization & BB guidelines – what are the items referred to here? Can we add an excel sheet here? Does it match slide 11 numbers and classification?
 
We need to ensure all 3 slides have a similar numbers and classification of items. This in turn should reflect in our commercials. 
 
Request consulting to please validate this and revert.

Subject: EBL upgrade proposal...revised proposal and an important disclaimer
 
Suresh & Shine,
 
1.	I have attached the proposal with a few more changes since the version of last night. Let’s use it for our conversation later today.
 
2.	While reading through the commercials, please note the line item definitions below :
3.	 
a.	Essential Implementation = Basic product upgrade+ Retrofits + Data Migration+ Integrations + Post live Support
b.	ODT enablement= A six month long intense collaborative ODT enablement exercise
			 
3.	An important disclaimer:
4.	 
a.	You may find one of the two options-the ‘Self Reliant Option’ that puts the onus of the entire BBG and Additional customizations on EBL. We do not believe that EBL can do all the BBG and Additional customizations on their own; but that’s the expectation set during the workshop in Jan. We have to revisit this.
 
Happy Selling.

The same criteria (as evaluation for functional specifications) will be applied to product demonstration also.

Dear All,

 

We are yet to receive the revised bid pack by incorporating the GRM comments. The work plan is yet to be uploaded for bid review. The contract document is yet to be incorporated as per the new template provided.  The responses are not provided for all the comments in OSN.

Kindly note that the RFP contains several non-standard terms. Have highlighted few of them in OSN.  We would like to see the responses for the same. Legal has to validate if the non-standard terms are being considered and may seek further approvals, if applicable.

Request to kindly set the expectation for the submission date.  As informed earlier, the bid entails secondary review as well.

Regards,

Sundar

Hi Awadhesh – 

 

Attached the excel copy with our final comments in column K. Also attached is a draft OD which is not yet approved. The excel file has cross references to the OD. All changes are further highlighted in the OD. Please review. This version and the changes are not yet approved by Oracle’s internal approval process. I am sending the same to you so that we can affect closure quickly.

 

Vinayak & Manish are available at 5:30 PM on Monday 11-Jun-2018 to discuss any residual open points and close all outstanding issues. 

 

Please confirm your availability. Once we have agreed, we will run the OD with our approval system. If further meeting is not necessary and current draft OD is acceptable, please let me know asap and I can start the approval process tonight.

 

In the interim, for any clarification, please do not hesitate to call me.

Team,

Kamal had called me stating that he needs this OD to be closed urgently. I have told him that from Oracle side, I also need this closed asap and my team has told me that no significant item is waiting on Oracle. Please highlight to me if you need my intervention anywhere.

Respectfully,

Vinayak

Hi Madhur

Project timelines and milestones are fixed. We have debated on this at length and cannot have the word tentative for timelines. This is what you need to address with your reviewers. The plan can be rebaselined within the agreed timelines and milestones. 

We cannot have tentative for the duration of project and milestones. Change orders can be there for change in scope impacting timelines. M

@Manish: We spoke last night at length. Appreciate if you can guide the team to close these perceived sticky points and move forward.

Hi Awadhesh – 

 

Thanks for your note. Before we get on a call, can you please get an opinion on the underlined portion in the email below. This will be a sticking point for both teams. Otherwise, we can let the experts discuss and close this out.

Madhur

 

I am requesting Satyen to setup a call and resolve this as we will lose far too much time going back and forth on emails.

 

Manish and I had a discussion last evening and he will brief you.There is no new ask beyond what we have discussed and agreed upon. Let us not move positions from June 12th conclusions summarized and shared by Raghu and Satyen.

Subject: RE: Fw: Canara Consulting OD from Oracle

HI Awadhesh – 

 

My responses are attached. 

 

In summary,

Line 10 – The new ask  is going way beyond the original ask of removing "" even if it is available in the current version"".  The only change possible is to go back to the original language 

Line 7  & 18 – Lot definitions are based on development dependencies, current lot definitions were arrived in similar fashion, hence “mutual agreement” is an extraneous ask and genuinely not possible to incorporate.

Line 19 – Payment criteria were agreed, we should not change them now.

Line 20 – Upon your request, the project plan has been added but explicit reference to 24 months is not possible. Also, our reviewers have highlighted that by making Project plan part if the OD, every change of the project plan would require a change order. Best to leave the word tentative over there. Please take legal opinion at your end as well.

Line 28 - Best we can do is 3 weeks. But by changing the document in approval cycle, we  will lose additional 4~6 days now.

 

Best Regards

Hi Satyen,
 
1.        PFA … updated draft OD.
 
2.        This OD is going through internal reviews and it’s moving into the next stage of finalization is subject the outcome of these reviews and  your agreement.
 
3.        Any changes from the version you saw last is in RED.
 
4.        One item that we agreed(verbally)  to in our discussions but was not in tracker : The content of the customization lots can vary from what’s indicated; and we told you why. (I have taken care put an obligation on Oracle to let you know 45 days prior to delivery as to what’s coming in the lot.)
 
5.        I have also sought 30 day’s time (after you have done your piece) for us to set up the test environments. 
 
Enjoy your weekend. Take your family out.  
 
Nevertheless, happy to talk about the OD anytime.
 
-Raghu

Noted. You can continue your conversation with Kishor on this deal.

Hi Raghu,

 

I do not understand why there are multiple touch points during this RFP response preparation. We have been communicating with Kishor (copied on this email now) and have sent the requisite information to him including a formal proposal.

 

Also, I do not see any Partner Inputs excel file or any “Read Me” tab in the attached excel file.

 

I am copying Vinod from SmartERP who has been coordinating this effort

 

 

 

Best Regards

Hi Anand,

 

 

Need the following from you:

1.	PFA Teaming agreement. Please sign & and send to me by EOD.  (You seem to have used the Singapore teaming agreement the last time around. Please use the attached India template)

 

2.	I need quite some inputs from you to submit to the bank. What I really need is mentioned in the ‘Read Me’ Tab of the attached xls.

 

3.	Please fill up the attached Excel sheet (Partner Inputs). Please send me the first version by Friday EOD – at the minimum, the costing and the project plan need to be filled in. You can send incremental versions later on (for each version, please keep updating the version number)  – however, please do not change the price / plan as we will be initiating approvals based on this

 

4.	In addition, we will require a formal proposal also which is binding. We can work on this once we complete filling the above Excel sheet.

 

5.	Please do not hesitate to call me if you need help.

 

 

 

-Raghu

Expert Huddle
 
A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Originally developed as the accounting method for the virtual currency Bitcoin, blockchains - which use what's known as distributed ledger technology (DLT) - are appearing in a variety of commercial applications today.  
While this is common knowledge, a little more deep dive into how it works, what is it used for will probably answer many of the questions from some of our little professors.
Join us for a session on BLOCKCHAIN by Vineet Timble.


Vineet Timble
Consulting Solution Director
Vineet is part of the Primesourcing business group and takes great interest in Block chain technology and its applicability. He has been with us for over 20 years now. He is well known amongst his peer groups for his outstanding ability to understand and appreciate Technology. He takes great pride in learning a technology in depth and has exemplified in leading by example for his team members as well.
Vineet will share his insights with us on 5th October from 2pm to 4 pm. 
There will be a Q&A session by the end of his presentation. We welcome all of you to join for this session as per the details given below.

Satyen,

 

       When can I take you/your team through the OD. 

 

I agree with your expectations from the changed OD. I need to explain to you how the amendment meets your requirements.

 

Can we have a call very early?

Subject: Re: Canara Upgrade: Draft version of OD amendment to accommodate FC ver 11.8 change

 

Raghu,
Thanks for sharing this OD. I understand from my team the objectives are as follows

1. Change the Version to 11.8
2. Change the Project Plan to reflect a delay of 3 Months
3. Change the Deliverables - Optional
4. Change the Payment Terms to reflect the change in deliverable timeline

Our Initial Observations on the OD are as follows

1. As we discussed, you need to write a statement to change the version from 11.7 to 11.8 in the OD & FPE
2. The No. of Lots, as I understand, has changed to 5 from 4. We need to correct our understanding.
3. The Statement that you are inserting on the Lot Completions (5.c in ‘DEVELOPMENT OF CUSTOMIZATION ’ in Pg 3 of FPE) is not clear or the purpose of this is not clear.


In my view we will have 2 short calls.

1. To Reach an understanding on the net changes in the OD - in next 2 days
2. To finalize a language to effect these changes. - By End of this week.

We need your help and concurrence on this plan.

Thanks
Satyen

  _____  





Dear Satyen,

Here’s the draft OD-Amendment. 

At first glance, it may not be obvious as to how it works. I will explain that.

Once you understand how it works, it will be apparent to you that we are still trying to do a 24 month project, but just getting some extra time in case something goes wrong. 

Please note: I have to find-replace all reference to 11.7 with 11.8 at many places it the OD. You should read the attached OD assuming that it has been done.

Subject: RE: Flexcube for Sberbank India

 

Hi Anatoly, Dmitry, Raghu,

I would like to introduce you to each other:

Raghu is Director-Client Services in Oracle Financial Services India.

Anatoly  is a managing director and Dmitry is a head of development group in transactional business tribe, who will supervise Sberbank India.

 

Raghu,

Several questions from Dmitry:

1.	Does Sberbank India have global or Indian version of Flexcube? 

Sberbank has India version of FLEXCUBE.

2.	Could you please kindly share again our proposal for Flexcube upgrade?

We have not shared any formal proposal with you for FLEXCUBE upgrade, but we will be happy to do so.

3.	What will be the location for upgrade works if Flexcube servers are in Moscow – Delhi or Moscow?

The upgrade happens out of India.

4.	Could you please specify who is the partner who can provide regulatory reporting as per Dmitry’s list? How to get estimation for the same?

     We do not have a particular in mind. We will introduce you to a few partners from whom you can select. We will help you to get an estimate. 

 

Dmitry is going to get access to My Oracle Support now.

 

Best Regards,

 

Irina

               Except for some 20 reports, the remaining 112 reports are regulatory reports. Regulatory reporting in FLEXCUBE is available from our partners who have a readymade (Out of the box) integration with FLEXCUBE 11.8 (the proposed upgrade version). In other words, when they do an upgrade to FC 11.8, the regulatory reporting component will be built in parallel by our partners, who have done the work at other Indian Banks. We have already indicated a price estimate to Sber India for the upgrade. On top of this, we have to factor in the reg reporting piece.

All of our competitions are global player like us. Reg reporting changes by the day & its unlikely that any global product can change every day in response to regulation change in one country.

All,

 

Please find attached an agenda based on given below request from Saraswat Bank. In order to cover this agenda, we will need 3 full days to cover topics on business and technology as requested by the bank in their e-mail.

 

Following are additional points that bank has asked for, we need to discuss as to how best they can be addressed:

 

*	Microfinance (we can cover what we have done for JFS)
*	Recovery / Collections (not asked in RFP)
*	Corporate Loans (not asked in RFP, but can cover it through FCR itself)
*	Fixed Assets (not asked in RFP but we can present through UBS)
*	Membership module (demo/present what we showed to BCCB)

 

As of now the session can be done in the week of 17th Dec 2018 as Manish Gupta will be back by this time, we will definitely need him for this session.

 

Will also need support from Consulting team for the functional sessions on Loans, Payments and Clearing in addition to the tech session on Day 03.

 

Hi Prasad, 

 

Sessions for OBIEE and Regulatory Reporting have been scheduled for Day 03, let’s sync up on how we can get OBIEE Consultant from Oracle and Nelito on board for these sessions. Additionally, have also planned for overview of Digital Banking on Day3. Let me know if this is fine.

 

Hi Lakshmi, 

 

We plan to have Saraswat bank demo in the week of 17th Dec. It will be on the same lines as BCCB.  Request your support to conduct these sessions. 

 

 

Thanks & Regards

Subject: CBS Upgrade - FLEXCUBE Scope rationalization 

 

Hi Zahid, Tapash,

 

Thanks for the detailed discussion yesterday. Please find attached module set rationalized and sequenced into Phase 1 & Phase 2. Also, as discussed please share the finalized HW BOM so that we can validate the same with our infrastructure team  

 

Key Points - License & Implementation Modules

 

1.	All Oracle enterprise Business suite (EBS) module have been removed as we are no longer positioning them. GL will be from FLEXCUBE like it is in current system  
2.	Treasury related Modules (Exchange Traded Derivatives have been removed) 
3.	OFSAA -  AML & KYC modules have been removed as EBL is procuring another system for this. FTP & ALM retained and will be implemented after Phase 1 
4.	Cash management (Liquidity management) and Syndicated loans are included as part of Phase 2 (license was optional now made mandatory. To be now included in Implementation
5.	Some areas marked as not required but interfaces to these systems need to be built (as stated in the excel. E.g. retail origination, Tablet banking)
6.	Login Acumen will be planned for Phase 2 
7.	Regarding point #15 (Digital banking – social media interface, AI) I will revert after internal discussions. Your ask is that it should be part of the scope and can be phase 2 

 

Key Additional Points – Implementation 

 

1.	Projects to sequenced into Phase 1 and Phase 2 to de risk the program  
2.	All current interfaces and customizations need to be taken forward into upgraded version in phase 1 
3.	New Customizations and their priority to be discussed and agreed – file already sent to EBL today 

 

Warm Regards,

 

Rajesh

Tapash,

 

As discussed yesterday, I have attached the items from the RFP where we need clarity if these are required and if these are already being managed in FLEXCUBE .  Also if you can add a priority ( 1.2,3) to these items it will help .

 

Looking forward to receiving this feedback by Wednesday EOD Dhaka time .

 

I will be sending the finalized module set in a while

Subject: RE: Flexcube Module Mapping

 

Dear Prasad, 

We have started checking your BOM.  But it is found that you have excluded few of the mandatory modules in your BOM. 

 

As discussed with you last Friday, we will check internally when to schedule the normalization onsite meeting with Oracle and confirm you. 

 

 

Best Regards,

  Here’s what I am curious about:

 

*	Do we want to get ML into our products?  If yes, is there a method to figuring out ML use cases? 
*	What’s the domain of our interest…Enterprise data, video, images?
*	What’s our approach to ML? Will we build horizontal products or standalone vertical products? Or do we want to build services offerings to deliver ML? Or cloud APIs?
*	Some peek into our ML IP development…More specifically ..how do we architect the solutions…Do we apply transfer learning or build ‘grounds up’ architecture.
*	What are the tools & libraries of interest…CNN/RNN, Pytorch, Tensorflow.
*	How are you building the organization? What kind of people you have and what kind of people do you want to join you?

#14 : There will be Infosec risk, as we might need to have read only access to the customer data for providing service(investigation/analysis of tickets etc). Please high light this as risk in Infosec questionnaire, with proper mitigation steps to be taken for the same. Same is mitigations steps required tobe documented in RAW sheet as well (3.13)

Subject: FW: Kerala Bank RFP - CBS

 

Suren / Manish,

 

We have received the Kerala bank RFP and are starting work on it. But we need some clarity on product positioning:

1.	Do we bring in OB Payments for all domestic & international payments (I heard that OB Pay also has UPI) – FT / PC / EMS are no longer licensable components.
2.	Do we bring in OBCL – for commercial / trade related loans? – Commercial loans in not licensable
3.	Do we bring in ELCM – this is considered to be a separate licensable component now.

 

This is not relevant only for Kerala Bank – but in general for the India market.

 

With the above 3, we need to also decide on:

*	Existing localizations – how do we bridge the gap?
*	Integrations
*	How will the deployment architecture look like

 

This is extremely urgent and will send a calendar to discuss this today. Please dial in.

 

Regards,

Anuja

Hi All

The Kerala State Cooperative Bank is back with the CBS RFP.  Attached is the latest RFP documents downloaded from their site.  Key points to note:


1.	RFP bid can be  submitted either by OEM or SI lead
2.	Scope – CBS and allied services  - Supply and implementation of software, including migration from existing software, Supply & installation of necessary hardware and network infrastructure Management of services such as Data centre, Disaster recovery centre, NDR providing onsite maintenance & support on sight maintenance and support to all Banks during migration and after migration for specified period of the contract 
3.	Key Dates:

Prebid queries – 15 March (Friday next week)

Prebid meeting – 22 March

Bid submission – 17 Apr

4.	3 cover bid – Pre-qual, Technical & Functional and Financial – Reverse auction of Technically shortlisted vendors.  Selection criteria will be Quality and Cost Based (QCBS) with 70% weightage for Technical round and 30% to the Reverse auction.

 

I have not gone through the RFP in detail, forwarding to you all so we can quickly go through and put across our thoughts.   

 

Anuja / Faisal can you please help clarify where all we will need SI to step in the overall scope so my conversation with IBM can be accordingly done? I’m yet to speak to IBM on the SI option.

 

Thanks & Rgds

We have to decide on:

(1)    If this RFP construct will work for us per Oracle policies – eg: Oracle priming the RFP submission with SI  and 3rd party jointly, though individual contracts will be signed directly by Bank.  

If not, we go to Bank next week with our specific asks before they publish final RFP OR start working on internal approvals so that we are able to bid 

 

(2)    Our SI strategy – we will need to take their inputs before meeting the Bank next week

(3)    Any other feedback / observations on the RFP from Solution, Implementation or T&Cs 

 

Need to agree a date next week to meet the Bank at Kolkata for our feedback on the RFP and finalise the team for the meeting.

Setting the Course for Success
Achieving success with aligned goals and continuous feedback
Dear All,

We are preparing with a new focus on how we manage performance and drive employee and organizational success through aligned goals, continuous feedback, and ongoing conversations between managers and employees.

The entire Performance Management System has been revamped and introduced in the HCM tool. We have organized two sessions to equip you with the necessary understanding of the HCM Goals and Career Development Tool. At the end of the session, the participants would be able to understand how to update and leverage the modules towards their performance and development (career) goals in the HCM tool.

Topic: "" Advanced Analytical Techniques for Financial Crime Detection ""


 

 
It is being said that Artificial Intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Companies around the world are applying Artificial Intelligence to enhance their offerings, become more competitive,  and better serve their customers. Oracle (and OFSS) are no exceptions. At Oracle Open World last year, Larry Ellison's keynote presentation focused on Oracle's drive to deeply embed AI capability in all of Oracle's products, and if you look carefully at his slides you will find Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crime analytics mentioned as one of the pioneering applications too that use such advanced analytics.


 
This talk will introduce you to Machine Learning (a branch of AI) and Graph Analytics and explain how these advanced techniques are used in our applications. While many applications built by us embed these capabilities, Financial Crime domain (for e.g Fraud) is used to provide a more readily understandable context for explaining these complex topics. Listen in if you are simply curious about Machine Learning or if you are familiar with the concepts but would like to know how it is used in our own applications.

Subject: FY20 Consulting Sales connects and Booking process sync up
 
Hi all,
 
In view of the revised model for DigX Consulting sales, I am listing down the governance processes for Sales booking for DigX opportunities. These are for DigX led deals, either pure OBDX or majority OBDX/FCDB with some component of UBS/FC core. The Banking led combo process will continue as it was for last year. 
 
1.       Opportunity Management: While we will be connected from the beginning for majority of these opportunities, it will be good to have a weekly connect irrespective, given the org process for weekly forecasting. There could be need for you to join review session fortnightly or monthly with Teji, while I represent on your behalf to him during weekly meetings
a.       Weekly sync-up calls (20 mins /territory) between each Sales rep and me, on opportunity pipeline covering – new opportunities, status updates on existing ones, next actions with timelines
b.       Sales Cloud updates and Forecast submission by Sales reps based on the outcome of sync up calls. Submitted forecast reports will be the basis for reviews with Teji, hence key to have these updated.
c.       In view of the Forecast submission timelines, I will schedule this on Friday or Monday to start with. Individual meeting requests will be sent out separately.
2.       Bid Management sync-ups: Agree on the bid management process and sync ups between Vikram (DigX bid manager) with Banking bid managers from respective territory, for GRM reviews and LOB approvals. I will schedule a separate call later this week to finalise this. Please let me know if you have specific bid managers mapped by Sales territory from the Banking side.
3.       PA creations and Booking Ops: I will schedule a connect with the Delivery Managers/PMs and Ops team to understand and agree on the R&R for the various activities relating to the booking cycle. While the general processes remain same, it will be better to re-iterate as the actual teams working on these are different.
 
I have attached a sheet mapping each country in the region with the Sales rep. Let me know if there is any disconnect here. Once finalised, I will share this with the Ops teams.
 
Regards,
Nikhil

Nogs – this is good insight

 

Pronomita – please pull in Ajit. We should discuss internally on Tuesday and see if we can do a quick visit to Thrissur

 

Vikram had shown me glimpses of what we are doing in next version of OBDX – we are getting there on lines similar to Back Base. We need to reposition our pitch on the basis of this version – check with Ajit on whether we can talk about this to DLB

Manish,

Ramya updated me - while last week's OBDX demo was highly liked by DLB, they are now flirting with iExceed who have given them the impression in 6 months time they will have a better product than Oracle's !

While it may appear to defy logic why would a Bank be willing to bet on a company that says they will have a better product not today, not next month but after SIX MONTHS, the takeaway is a lower price point (something like 10 cr FC and 1.2 cr OBDX) and a similar reduction on licenses would have tipped it more firmly in Oracle's favor.
That said, the second input i hear is they have low level of faith in our Digital services & support quality. The impression is Oracle Banking (CBS) is strong and for Digital and more tech-centric solutions they should look for more ""specialized"" players like iExceed who are into Digital as their bread & butter.

I would request the two of you and someone senior from Digital to visit DLB this week and help swing them back and away from iExceed / TCS. Basically give the necessary commitments and pitch on solution, services and price like iExceed would do without blinking their eyelids, the only diff would be we would sell on the basis of what we HAVE TODAY, while iExceed would potentially do that on the basis of what they DO NOT HAVE but will somehow build something before being found out... 

And while at it, we actually walk them thru an imple project plan that shows step by step how this will be delivered in quick time to market, get their buy in the room, and come back and churn an OD in no time before they change their mind.

Subject: Shamrao Vithal Bank - updates and solutioning discussion

 

Sorry for the long mail …………

 

 

Dear All,

 

We have been engaging with Shamrao Vithal Bank for their trade and treasury requirement from Apr 8th, 2019  where the requirement for a generic demo was scoped for Trade, Limits  and Treasury demonstration for the bank.

Prasad can validate further if he is aware of other competitors if any were invited as I understood we were the only one.

 

As part of the one day demo following points came out clearly :

 

*	They wish to continue with their existing CBS- named Genius for retail banking and that would be the master for Customer /Customer accounts/Limits .
*	So their immediate look out was only for the Trade and Treasury related requirements.

 

Subsequent to the detailed discussion and demo,  a site visit on July 5th, 2019 was arranged with Yes Bank and bank seemed to have given a good feedback on trade functionalities and Bank team also appreciated what they discussed. At Yes Bank as BO is the reporting tool they were not given much insights on the reporting aspects.

 

On 2nd Aug , 2019 there was a call with the bank team where they wanted to have a further detailed discussion with Oracle team and make decision .

They wanted to scope the following as part of next discussion where they plan to come to our GO office :

 

a.	Solution we would propose to them. Basically finalization of the modules 
b.	Integration touch points
c.	Regulatory Reporting
d.	IDPMS/EDPMS understanding
e.	SWIFT connectivity etc., 
f.	Functionality where they saw few pain points in their current system
g.	Implementation strategy
h.	Hardware sizing etc.,

 

 

Given  the above background we internally need to discuss on the following with larger team :

 

a.	Solution stack that we wish to propose for this bank . As here proposal is only for the corporate part of FC solution how would we go about in terms of proposing the base modules.

Had it been the erstwhile FC[R+C] we could propose base, CASA separately. In the merged architecture in FC where CIF and CASA now reside in Retail  can we still go about proposing the Core Base + CASA as individual modules ? Even though their CBS will be master, I assume we may still need our CASA to hold balances for settlement etc.,

Please guide if there is any gap in my understanding here and what would the best option be ?

b.	If the above CIF/CASA module cannot be proposed separately in the new architecture of FC, then can we directly have an online integration established with the Customer/accounts of their CBS system Or any other suggestions also welcome.
c.	Limits currently they maintained domestic limits and fcy limits in their system of which they plan to moved FCY limits into Oracle offered module but wanted to discuss whether it would be good to maintain only FCY limits here or both limits need to come from one module. 
d.	 Regulatory reporting and Operational Reporting   is limited to the Trade /Treasury reports that they have shared with us ( refer attached mail from bank). So would it be wise to propose Nelito for these sets of reports alone or should we take this as an opportunity to push through Nelito for all of the regulatory requirement. Need inputs ?

 

Based on everyone’s availability we can get on a call and discuss these points  as we need to 

 

a.	Check how viable the proposal is going to be 
b.	Bank has been following up on  date for the next presentation so we need to think on this fast and give our go ahead and have participation from everyone 

 

For visibility on corporate modules that should go from our stack please refer below :-

 

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Letter of Credit 

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Bills and Collections

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Fund Transfer – this was shown for Advance remittance scenario. Oracle Banking Payment we need to know if the same will handle 

                                                                                                              the requirement. Else need approval for FT module.

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Foreign Exchange ……..as this will be required for trade related transactions they wanted to have the linkage within single application  

                                                                                                                         for tracking.

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Commercial Loans

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Money Market - Optional

•            Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking Securities -Optional

 

 

Have not proposed the OB Payment module etc., as it is only the Advance Remittance that needs to be addressed here for which FT should be good enough.

If base modules are proposed then we have to add them to this.

 

 

Please let us know suitable time at the earliest as your inputs is very important for us to discuss and decide on way forward. Calendar will be raised after hearing from all on availability. 

 

Thanks and Regards

Lakshmi

Subject: RE: Request for meetings on 9th and 12th September for consulting services OD discussion and closure

Dear Manjith,

Did the team get a chance to review the different categories mentioned ? We need to get to the next step of closing the scope of the OD and the cost and then process the consulting services OD.

As discussed in the meetings held on 16th and 19th September 2019. The items have been categorized into the following categories …

1.      Build required : Customization required. Bank team will need to review the scope mentioned in column K “Build scope”  and once mutually agreed on the scope/cost then they will go into the Services OD.

2.      Build not required : From the discussions we understand that there is no customization to be done in Flexcube.

3.      Query Pending on Oracle:  Team has responded to the queries  that came up in the meeting on 16th and 19th September. Responses are in column K. Once mutually agreed , the items would be categorized into “Build required” or “Build Not required”.

	

	There are 3 queries which are pending for us to respond to as mentioned in mail below by Piyush to which we will be responding shortly.

4.      Bank to check : There were points which the bank was to check and come back and based on the same, the items would be categorized into “Build required” or “Build Not required”.

5.      Duplicate :   Items which are duplicate to other items. The items which are duplicate are in column K.

If there are specific queries then we can meet at 2:30 pm over call. We can publish the bridge. 

Regards,

Cherian

a.	What is the Oracle version in use for the existing CBS version? In DC & DR
b.	What is the existing hardware configuration? memory, compute, storage?
c.	OS along with versions
d.	What are the existing interfaces, more specifically which are the external interfaces & what’s the nature of the interface?
e.	S/w components – along with versions and options pack
f.	Load balancers…if any?

 

You can use the attached sheet(pre-filled as a sample) to provide this information. 

 

If you can send the above info before the call on e-mail, it will save time.

 

Also, if you can retrieve an architecture diagram and some brief description from your records and share it,  it will help.

We’ve discussed everything with Raghu already. Key points that we’ve discussed are the following:

 

1.       We require detailed description of the processes (operation?), which should be implemented in CBS and Internet-banking.

2.       description should include regulatory requirements of RBI, ministries and other governing agencies in India.

3.       SOW should not be prepared with reference to a specific solution. Such solution and implementation partner will be chosen in the next procurement procedure.

4.       If there are additional questions, Andrew Beloglazov and myself will get involved.

Dear All,

 

As we start with the FY21 learning journey, it is our pleasure to invite you for a 60 minute free webinar on “The Anti-fragile Mind Of A Leader, ” a very apt session for each one of us as we navigate our personal and professional lives through these difficult times of Covid-19.

 

“Anti-fragile”, a term coined by influential analyst and writer Nicholas Nassim Taleb, is the opposite of Fragile – the condition we experience when extreme adversity (like COVID-19) overwhelms us. Resilience is often thought of as the answer to adversity, but will Resilience be enough to deal with the next crisis? Anti-fragility is beyond Resilience - the Resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the Anti-fragile gets better. 

 

This Webinar discusses Anti-fragility in the context of Leadership - being future ready for volatility and uncertainty.

 

Session Details:


Date

24th July


Time

4:30pm to 6:00pm (IST)

Hi Dinakar,

  Good morning to you. 

Except for 13 hrs India time to 16.30 hrs, I am fine for our discussion any time on Monday.

As I could find myself in a low band width zone on Monday, I hope its fine for us to do an audio discussion(just in case video takes up too much bandwidth). 
Please do let me know.

   I joined the Cloud Enablement team a month ago from Sales. I focus on making the FS GBU Cloud offerings better. One area that I am working on is Service Observability & Monitoring.

 

 

In this context, Marco was mentioning that you are having some issues around reporting Service uptimes back to the customer. But when I spoke to the AMS teams, they said that this has now been resolved ever since they got direct access to download & send the availability reports from the monitoring systems. And they share these reports with you.  I just want to kick start our interaction with this topic and schedule (if required) regular calls.

   All three of us agree that the CAR entry pertaining to the situation when the monitoring service comes up after the target service(OFSLL) in this case needs to be reported differently. 

 

What we need to arrive at is: How do we report it in a way that is optically correct. 

 

 

Sunil: Your thoughts will drive Naman’s actions. So, please take the first stab on this.

   Yesterday, we had a call with Martin Tillyer. Martin mentioned that you are doing an M&O pilot. 

 

Your experience & guidance is important to us. We will want to draw lessons from that before we exhort other Saas Groups to do a similar pilot.

 

Some specific things that we would like you to talk about are…

 

a.	What was the motivation to explore M&O? More specifically which problem(s) are you facing that M&O can potentially solve? Performance  problem, Availability Problem, Observability problem , etc.
b.	How did you actually go about doing the pilot? Sequence of steps in the pilot engagement
c.	In particular what was the actual process of instrumenting OHI application code like? How did you figure out where to put in the ‘instrumentation code’
d.	How did you educate yourself on what metric could potentially be tracked & of this how did you choose the metrics that you want to track?
e.	Anybody other than Martin( & team),  whose expertise you are able to leverage?
f.	What’s the effort that is going in & how much do you expect to get done with that effort.
g.	What are you M&O’ing only GBUCS or CFS ? Is the application code base same for both? If yes, is the instrumentation code also the same?

 

Anything that I should have asked, but forgot….please answer too.

 

-Raghu Iyer

     I would like to know why you want to do a pilot/POC. 

What’s the ‘pain’/problem that you have that GBU-DIS will solve?

What is the objective of the POC?...more specifically, what is the point  that the POC will prove?

What is the timeline to start conclude the POC?

I would like to understand the functional use cases ? What are the predications that you want to make …which may result in decisions?

Whom are you guys talking to in the GBUDIS team?
